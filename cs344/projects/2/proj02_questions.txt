1) Which language was easier Python or Impcore? Why?
    Python was easier. Half of time time with Impcore, I was chasing parenthesis. I understand the syntax for python,
    and it was extremely easy to convert my functions over to it.

2)Did not having the built-in libraries make it harder?
    Yes, it did. The libraries needed had to be implemented by recursion. My implementation is much slower and harder
    to understand than the python implementation.

3) Which gave a more accurate answer? Why?
    Impcore did because it only can understand integers. In python, i had to cast the majority of the divisions to
    maintain the same functionality as Impcore had
