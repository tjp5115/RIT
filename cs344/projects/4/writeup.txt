1)Which of the three languages was easier, Python, Impcore, or Standard ML? Why?
	Python, could use or,and conditionals. If there was one in standard ML, i could not get it to work. I had to create my own.

2) Which took longer to implement? Why?
	Impcore, figuring out how to implement some of the functions recursively took some time. 
	Since the algorithm was already created, I could copy that algorithm to my standard ML project

3)Which took more code to implement?
	Impcore, had 255 lines of code almost 40 more than the Standard ML project.
