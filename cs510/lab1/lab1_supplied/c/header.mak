# This header.mak file will set up all necessary options for compiling
# and linking C programs which use SFML on the CS Ubuntu systems.  IT
# WILL NOT WORK CORRECTLY FOR C++ PROGRAMS.
#
# To use it, place it in the same directory as your source code, and
# run the command
#
#	gmakemake > Makefile
#
# To compile and link your program, just run "make".
#
# If you want to take advantage of GDB's extra debugging features,
# change "-g" in the CFLAGS and LIBFLAGS macro definitions to "-ggdb".
