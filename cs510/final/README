I emailed the professor about the image having only two objects. His response is below. This is only to show that
I did not just add a random object into the scene.

The email i received is below:


Me:
Can we use Blender to create our polygon meshes and load the OBJ file into
opengl, or do you want us to use a separate program with the vertices hard
coded like we have been doing?

Professor Carithers:
Either way is fine.  There's a nice tutorial on doing OBJ loading at
<http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-7-model-loading/>.

Me:
Also, I like this image <http://i.stack.imgur.com/X5moL.jpg>, but it only
has two objects. Can i add another one to it, or should i pick another
Image.

Professor Carithers:
That's a really interesting image - simple, but not trivial to render.
I'd accept it as-is, but you could easily add a second instance of the
righthand object, maybe translated a bit and rotated a bit (perhaps 45
to 90 degrees more) to show the beveling from a different angle.
